Description: The hotspots package is designed to look within a set of measured values of a variable and identify values that are disproportionately high based on both the deviance of any given value from a statistical distribution and its similarity to other values. Because this relative magnitude of each value is taken into account, a value that is a statistical outlier may not always be a hot spot if other values are similarly large.
